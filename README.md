# CPSC1230 - Data Structures
-------------
This is the data structures and algorithms course in the Online Bachelor of Computer Science program, and it is one of the cornerstone courses for this curriculum. In this course, I will learn about developing programs that use data structures and collections to efficiently store data. Emphasis will be placed on the interplay between effective data structures and efficient algorithms.
